    "Flight delays cost airlines billions annually through crew scheduling disruptions, gate misallocations, and passenger compensation while frustrating travelers through missed connections and uncertainty. This multi-phase project aims to predict domestic flight departure delays in minutes two hours before scheduled departure, enabling proactive airline operations and improved passenger experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics On-Time Performance dataset (covering over 70 million flights from 2015–2021), integrated with NOAA Integrated Surface Database weather observations and airport metadata, we identify key delay patterns and build a predictive modeling framework. Exploratory data analysis revealed that while 80% of flights operate within 15 minutes of schedule, delays are highly variable (mean 10 minutes, σ = 38), with elevated occurrences on Mondays, Sundays, and during peak summer months. These findings highlight the importance of temporal, network, and weather-related predictors for delay forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Phase 1, we chose to frame this as a regression problem predicting continuous delay times, evaluated using RMSE which provides an interpretable measure of average prediction error in minutes that can be directly understood by stakeholders. Predictions were post-processed into delay buckets and assessed using the domain-specific metrics: On-Time Performance Prediction Accuracy and Severe Delay Detection Rate. These metrics aim to assess both practical and statistical impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Phase 2, we established a baseline linear regression model using a robust 6-stage feature engineering pipeline encompassing data preparation, median imputation, categorical encoding, feature assembly, standardized scaling, and model training. We selected linear regression as our baseline for its interpretability, computational efficiency on distributed systems, and ability to establish clear performance benchmarks for subsequent model comparisons. Using expanding window cross-validation across five temporal folds, our baseline model achieved a test set RMSE of 35.96 minutes\n",

Please refer to the definitions of these additional metrics in the Appendix.\n",

    "\n",
    "**On-Time Prediction Accuracy** measures the accuracy of predicting flights within a narrow tolerance window (+/- 5 minutes), which is critical for operational planning because resource allocation decisions, such as gate assignments, crew scheduling, and passenger communication, require precise delay estimates rather than broad categorizations. \n",

On-Time flights help improve the reputation of the airline and keep the airport traffic smoothly moving. \n",

    "#### Severe Delay Detection Rate (SDDR)\n",

    "In order to develop our baseline model we conducted a variety of different experiments primarily focusing on changes to the data set to test scalability, null data handling, the use of cross validation and the dataset itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted the following Experments:\n",
    "1. Experiment 1: Does cross-validation effect performance?\n",
    "2. Experiment 2: Does imputation strategy effect performance?\n",
    "3. Experiment 3: Does a custom data set effect performance?\n",
    "- **Number of Experiments Conducted:**  3\n",
    "\n",
    "We changed the following variables to test these questions:\n",
    "- Scalabilty - Modifying the size of the dataset.\n",
    "- Data Cleanliness - Using the provided default data vs the one with the custom joins.\n",
    "- Data Leakage - The use of data without cross-validation vs with cross-validation.\n",
    "- Data Imputation - Dropping the null values or imputing the missing values with the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of the experiments conducted we kept the feature families and features the same as we are primarily testing to determine implementation details and in our next model plan to implement an improved linear regression model using Lasso regularization to perform feature selection for our more complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using our findings from the following experiments we then implement a final linear regression baseline model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class, trained only on the ten raw features that appear to have the most significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Families\n",
    "In order to create, experiment with and assess our baseline models we chose to evaluate our model using ten features which we've categorized into four types of feature families: Temporal Features, Airport Features, Weather Features and Flight Features. Within these feature families we chose the specific features based on their percieved importance, low number of null values and because they are limited in the amount of data leakage. Some features will entail some data leakage if they don't use cross validation and even with cross validation their may be some data leakage from our imputation strategies. The features affected by data leakage through imputation of the median are the Weather Factors: HourlyWindSpeed, HourlyVisibility and HourlyPrecipitation as these are the only features with null values. Additionally, some experiments may be impacted by data leakage through the train/val/test split. Note: The specific experiments affected by any form of data leakage are clearly outlined in each experiments Model Table. \n",
