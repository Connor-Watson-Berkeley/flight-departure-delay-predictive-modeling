    "# Time-Series Feature Engineering for Flight Delay Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook generates time-series based conditional expected values using Prophet models.\n",
    "These features capture temporal trends and seasonality for use in Flight Lineage feature engineering.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Time-Series Aggregations:\n",
    "1. **Global**: All flights aggregated by date\n",
    "2. **Per Airport**: Aggregated by origin airport and date\n",
    "3. **Per Airline (Carrier)**: Aggregated by carrier and date\n",
    "4. **Per Airport & Airline**: Aggregated by carrier-airport and date\n",
    "5. **Per Route (Origin-Dest)**: Aggregated by route and date (for air time)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of Interest:\n",
    "- **Departure Delay**: Expected departure delays (conditional on carrier, airport, time)\n",
    "- **Arrival Delay**: Expected arrival delays\n",
    "- **Air Time**: Expected flight time from origin to destination\n",
    "- **Taxi Times**: Expected taxi-in and taxi-out times\n",
    "- **Turnover Time**: Time between arrival and next departure (requires joining to prior leg - see note at end)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prophet Models:\n",
    "Each aggregation level uses Prophet to capture:\n",
    "- Long-term trends\n",
    "- Weekly seasonality\n",
    "- Yearly seasonality (if sufficient data)\n",
    "- Date-specific forecasts\n"
