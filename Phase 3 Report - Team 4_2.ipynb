    "Flight delays cost airlines billions annually through crew scheduling disruptions, gate misallocations, and passenger compensation while frustrating travelers through missed connections and uncertainty. This multi-phase project aims to predict domestic flight departure delays in minutes two hours before scheduled departure, enabling proactive airline operations and improved passenger experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics On-Time Performance dataset (covering over 70 million flights from 2015–2021), integrated with NOAA Integrated Surface Database weather observations and airport metadata, we identify key delay patterns and build a predictive modeling framework. Exploratory data analysis revealed that while 80% of flights operate within 15 minutes of schedule, delays are highly variable (mean 10 minutes, σ = 38), with elevated occurrences on Mondays, Sundays, and during peak summer months. These findings highlight the importance of temporal, network, and weather-related predictors for delay forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Phase 1, we chose to frame this as a regression problem predicting continuous delay times, evaluated using RMSE which provides an interpretable measure of average prediction error in minutes that can be directly understood by stakeholders. Predictions were post-processed into delay buckets and assessed using the domain-specific metrics: On-Time Performance Prediction Accuracy and Severe Delay Detection Rate. These metrics aim to assess both practical and statistical impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Phase 2, we established a baseline linear regression model using a robust 6-stage feature engineering pipeline encompassing data preparation, median imputation, categorical encoding, feature assembly, standardized scaling, and model training. We selected linear regression as our baseline for its interpretability, computational efficiency on distributed systems, and ability to establish clear performance benchmarks for subsequent model comparisons. Using expanding window cross-validation across five temporal folds, our baseline model achieved a test set RMSE of 35.96 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "[**TODO(Paul)**: WRITE ABOUT PHASE 3: plus the new experiments and the final model selected, as well as your final results (report the number!)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent phases expand the modeling scope through three complementary tracks: (1) advanced feature engineering capturing temporal dynamics (Prophet components, rolling delay aggregations, and flight network centrality metrics), (2) non-linear modeling using XGBoost, deep neural networks, and ensemble stacking to capture complex feature interactions, and (3) rigorous data leakage controls and phased evaluation to ensure performance reproducibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "This systematic, modular approach balances model sophistication with interpretability, targeting significant RMSE reduction while maintaining transparency for airline decision-makers and operational teams."

This makes sense due to the compounding nature of airline departure delays, as delays earlier in the day can compound to longer delays late at night. Ultra low-cost carriers such as NK (Spirit) and F9 (Frontier) once again have longer than average departure delay times. UA (United Airlines) does as well. This indicates that hour of day can also be a predictor of departure delays.\n",

You can see the wide variety of airports included in our dataset, from the American Samoa to Puerto Rico. Not pictured as an inset here is Guam.\n",

    "Instead of using actual durations (which leak future information), we train **meta-models** to **predict** these durations based on features that are available at prediction time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scheduled times**: Scheduled rotation time, scheduled turnover time, and scheduled flight time provide the baseline expectations for how long operations should take according to the carrier's schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temporal patterns**: Month, day of week, and hour of day (departure time block) capture diurnal and seasonal patterns, including jet stream variations that affect flight duration throughout the day and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weather conditions**: Wind speed/direction, precipitation, visibility, temperature, pressure, and humidity at origin and destination airports (available at prediction time) directly impact flight duration through headwinds, turbulence, and approach restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Airport and Trip characteristics**: Origin and destination airports, route distance, airport elevation, and network centrality (PageRank) capture route-specific and airport-specific operational patterns that influence duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can predict previous flight durations using only information available at prediction time, then use these predictions as features in our main departure delay model. This gives us the predictive power of duration features without the data leakage, enabling us to capture the cascading delay effects described in our fundamental theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "We considered several modeling approaches to prove the meta-model strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression**: Too simple (high bias) - would not capture the complex non-linear relationships between features and flight durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neural Network**: Would likely take too long to run/evaluate and require significant effort to tune (high variance risk). Given this was a proof-of-concept effort, the tuning overhead was prohibitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random Forest**: Offers a good balance of bias and variance, with strong predictive performance out-of-the-box requiring very minimal hyperparameter tuning. This was our initial choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **XGBoost**: Selected after benchmarking showed similar performance to Random Forest but with dramatically faster training times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Impact Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial runs included a preselected set of features (airport, route, temporal patterns), so feature selection was not rigorous. We systematically added features (hour of day, and the previous departing airport's weather) and measured incremental improvements, which are reported below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact of Hour of Day and Scheduled Duration Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: These features were added together in a single iteration, so the performance improvement reflects the combined impact of both feature sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before Adding Features** (3M dataset, Validation Set):\n",
    "- Previous Flight Turnover Time: R² = 0.334, RMSE = 249.62, MAE = 141.52\n",
    "- Previous Flight Rotation Time: R² = 0.322, RMSE = 183.37, MAE = 98.54\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Adding Hour of Day + Scheduled Duration Features** (3M dataset, Validation Set):\n",
    "- Previous Flight Turnover Time: R² = 0.527, RMSE = 222.87, MAE = 126.20 (+58% R² improvement)\n",
    "- Previous Flight Rotation Time: R² = 0.589, RMSE = 182.40, MAE = 100.07 (+83% R² improvement)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Added Features**:\n",
    "- **Hour of Day** (`dep_time_blk`): Categorical feature capturing time-of-day patterns (rush hours, maintenance windows, operational schedules)\n",
    "- **Scheduled Rotation Time**: Scheduled previous departure → scheduled current departure\n",
    "- **Scheduled Turnover Time**: Scheduled previous arrival → scheduled current departure\n",
    "- **Previous Flight Scheduled Flight Time**: Scheduled flight duration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: The combination of hour of day and scheduled duration features dramatically improved model performance. Hour of day captures temporal operational patterns (rush hours, maintenance windows), while scheduled durations provide baseline expectations that models can adjust from. Together, these features significantly improve turnover time and rotation time predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: More data dramatically improves turnover time and rotation time predictions (these have higher variance and more complex patterns). The improvement is most pronounced for turnover time, where R² improved by 49% and MAE improved by 63% (from 126.20 to 47.22 minutes).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Business Takeaway**: Meta-models are most reliable for normal operations (large actual durations show high R²). Very small actual durations (<1.5h) include both normal short operations and edge cases (cancellations, maintenance, data quality issues) where predictions are unreliable—these cases may need special handling in departure delay models. Turnover time (ground operations) shows the most variance and is hardest to predict, making it the primary driver of delay uncertainty.\n",

Please refer to the definitions of these additional metrics in the Appendix.\n",
